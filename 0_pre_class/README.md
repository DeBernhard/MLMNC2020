# Welcome to the Pre-Class Section!

Resources relevant for the first session on Monday, 2020-10-05,
are collected in this folder.

The resources referenced here introduce several key concepts that we will
revisit again and again during the course. Introducing them already at this
early stage will help you to actively participate in the class, ask questions
and discuss challenges you may experience.

To prepare yourself for the **pre-class test**, go through the following resources:
1. Book: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow \[HandsOn]:
  - CHAPTER 1, The Machine Learning Landscape
  - You can skip the parts on "Reinforcement Learning" and "Batch and Online Learning"
1. Book: Introduction to Statistical Learning \[ISL]:
  - 1 Introduction, An Overview of Statistical Learning
  - 2 Statistical Learning, 2.1 What Is Statistical Learning?

Note that hard copy versions of both books are available in the library.

The pre-class test is a multiple choice test comprising questions based on above material.

Optionally, you may want to take a look at the following two notebooks to
get a feeling for the programming-related aspects of the course:
- [Glossary](../glossary.ipynb)
- [Exercise notebook](./exsercise.ipynb)

<br>

If, with regards to the setup, anything is unclear to you, please do not
hesitate to contact us.

We are looking forward to welcoming you to our class!
