    "### Big Picture\n",
    "You are responsible for the implementation/rollout of a ML based system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on what you have learned so far, go through this [project checklist](https://tdgunes.com/COMP6246-2018Fall/lab1/extra1_3.pdf) (taken from the Hands On ML book) and select the three single items (not headlines but specific actions) you consider most important over all checks listed, i.e. three in total.\n",
    "   **In addition, add your choice to this [form](https://forms.gle/nZ8rzFKh72irCfn86).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Making\n",
    "A ML system should be used to automate a classification problem. Perform a simple \n",
    "analysis by computing the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) as $\\textrm{expected value} = \\sum_{\\textrm{all possible events}} \\textrm{probability of event} * \\textrm{value of event}$ (side note: this is similar to [risk assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk#Risk_assessment_and_analysis)).\n",
    "   \n",
    "As an example, revisit our toy classification problem for the moons data set and consider the [confusion matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html) (or see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix)) below.\n",
    "For each possible outcome, we expect the following value, i.e. profit or loss:\n",
    "- The model correctly predicts a positive outcome: 300\n",
    "- The model correctly predicts a negative outcome: 100\n",
    "- The model falsely predicts a positive outcome: -2000\n",
    "- The model falsely predicts a negative outcome: -200\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the expected value?\n",
    "3. Based on your assessment, do you recommend to use the ML system or not? Provide an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini Project\n",
    "You are tasked with predicting the value of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we consider \"[california housing prices](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#california-housing-dataset)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. List three specific tasks you consider important in tackling this problem.\n",
    "5. Perform three specific tasks (not necessarily the same) to approach a solution and describe your findings.\n",
